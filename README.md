# Life expectancy statistical analysis
 
This study aims to explore the relationship between various social, economic, and health factors and the life expectancy of 179 countries from the year 2000 to 2015. By analyzing this dataset, we hope to identify significant predictors of life expectancy and understand the impact of these factors on a global scale. The study employs both parametric and non-parametric bootstrap techniques to ensure the robustness of our statistical inferences.
