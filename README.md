# Life expectancy statistical analysis

# Overview
This study aims to explore the relationship between various social, economic, and health factors and the life expectancy of 179 countries from the year 2000 to 2015. By analyzing this dataset, we hope to identify significant predictors of life expectancy and understand the impact of these factors on a global scale. The study employs both parametric and non-parametric bootstrap techniques to ensure the robustness of our statistical inferences.

The dataset is made up of data gathered from the WHO open database which was uploaded on kaggle and can be found in the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who


# Objectives
To fit a linear regression model to predict life expectancy based on the available factors.
To apply non-parametric and parametric bootstrap methods to estimate the variability of the regression coefficients.
To construct confidence intervals for the regression coefficients using bootstrap techniques.
